Image to Grayscale ConverterA simple, efficient Python script that converts RGB images to grayscale using the luminosity method.DescriptionThis command-line tool takes an input image file, processes its pixel data using numpy matrix operations, and outputs a grayscale version. It utilizes standard colorimetric weights (Rec. 601) for the conversion to ensure the resulting grayscale image matches human brightness perception.FeaturesCommand Line Interface: Easy to run from a terminal with arguments for input and output paths.Weighted Conversion: Uses the formula Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B for natural-looking results.Error Handling: Checks for missing arguments and invalid file paths.PrerequisitesYou need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:numpymatplotlibInstallationClone this repository or save the script as main.py.Install the required packages using pip:pip install numpy matplotlib
UsageRun the script from your terminal using the following format:python main.py <input_img_file_path> <output_img_file_path>
Arguments<input_img_file_path>: The path to the image you want to convert (e.g., photo.jpg).<output_img_file_path>: The path (including filename) where the result should be saved (e.g., photo_gray.png).Examplepython main.py my_vacation.jpg grayscale_vacation.png
How It WorksLoad: The image is loaded into a NumPy array.Calculate: The script calculates the dot product of the RGB values with the weights [0.299, 0.587, 0.114]. This specific weighting accounts for the fact that human eyes are more sensitive to green light, less to red, and least to blue.Save: The resulting array is cast to unsigned 8-bit integers and saved using the 'gray' colormap.
